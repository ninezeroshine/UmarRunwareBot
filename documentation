How to connect and authenticate
Step-by-step guide on using our API via WebSockets for efficient and fast connection.
Authentication
To interact with the Runware API, you need to authenticate your requests using an API key. This key is unique to your account and is used to identify you when making requests. You can create multiple keys for different projects or environments (development, production, staging) , add descriptions to them, and revoke them at any time. With the new teams feature, you can also share keys with your team members.

To create an API key, simply sign up on Runware and visit the "API Keys" page. Then, click "Create Key" and fill the details for your new key.

HTTP (REST)
We recommend using WebSockets for a more efficient and faster connection. However, if you prefer to use a simpler connection and don't need to keep it open, you can use HTTP REST API.

The URL for the API is https://api.runware.ai/v1. All requests must be made using the POST method and the Content-Type header must be set to application/json.

The payload for each request is a JSON array with one or more objects. Each object represents a task to be executed by the API.

Authentication can be done by including the authentication object as the first element in the array, or by using the Authorization header with the value Bearer <API_KEY>.

curl --location 'https://api.runware.ai/v1' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data-raw '[
       {
         "taskType": "authentication",
         "apiKey": "<API_KEY>"
       },
       {
         "taskType": "imageInference",
         "taskUUID": "39d7207a-87ef-4c93-8082-1431f9c1dc97",
         "positivePrompt": "a cat",
         "width": 512,
         "height": 512,
         "model": "civitai:102438@133677",
         "numberResults": 1
       }
     ]'
The API will return a JSON object with the data property. This property is an array containing all the response objects. Each object will contain the taskType and the taskUUID of the request it's responding to, as well as other properties related to the task.

{
  "data": [
    {
      "taskType": "imageInference",
      "taskUUID": "39d7207a-87ef-4c93-8082-1431f9c1dc97",
      "imageUUID": "b7db282d-2943-4f12-992f-77df3ad3ec71",
      "imageURL": "https://im.runware.ai/image/ws/0.5/ii/b7db282d-2943-4f12-992f-77df3ad3ec71.jpg"
    }
  ]
}
If there's an error, the API will not return the data property. Instead, it will return the error property, containing the error message.

WebSockets
We support WebSocket connections as they are more efficient, faster, and less resource intensive. We have made our WebSocket connections easy to work with, as each response contains the request ID. So it's possible to easily match request → response.

The API uses a bidirectional protocol that encodes all messages as JSON objects.

To connect you can use one of the sdks we provide JavaScript, Python or manually.

If you prefer to connect manually (to use another language/technology), the endpoint URL is wss://ws-api.runware.ai/v1.

New connections
Request
WebSocket connections are point-to-point, so there's no need for each request to contain an authentication header.

Instead, the first request must always be an authentication request that includes the API key. This way we can identify which subsequent requests are arriving from the same user.

[
  {
    "taskType": "authentication",
    "apiKey": "<API_KEY>"
  }
]
Response
After you've made the authentication request the API will return an object with the connectionSessionUUID parameter. This string is unique to your connection and is used to resume connections in case of disconnection (more on this later).

{
  "data": [
    {
      "taskType": "authentication",
      "connectionSessionUUID": "f40c2aeb-f8a7-4af7-a1ab-7594c9bf778f"
    }
  ]
}
In case of error you will receive an object with the error message.

{
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "invalidApiKey",
      "message": "Invalid API key. Get one at https://my.runware.ai/signup",
      "parameter": "apiKey",
      "type": "string",
      "taskType": "authentication"
    }
  ]
}
Keeping connection alive
The WebSocket connection is kept open for 120 seconds from the last message exchanged. If you don't send any messages for 120 seconds, the connection will be closed automatically.

To keep the connection going, you can send a ping message when needed, to which we will reply with a pong.

[
  {
    "taskType": "ping",
    "ping": true
  }
]
{
  "data": [
    {
      "taskType": "ping",
      "pong": true
    }
  ]
}
Resuming connections
If any service, server or network is unresponsive (for instance due to a restart), all the images or tasks that could not be delivered are kept in a buffer memory for 120 seconds. You can reconnect and have these messages delivered by including the connectionSessionUUID parameter in the initial authentication connection request.

[
  {
    "taskType": "authentication",
    "apiKey": "<API_KEY>",
    "connectionSessionUUID": "f40c2aeb-f8a7-4af7-a1ab-7594c9bf778f"
  }
]
This means that is not needed to make the same request again, the initial one will be delivered when reconnecting.

SDK libraries reconnects automatically.



Image Inference API
Generate images from text prompts or transform existing ones using Runware's API. Learn how to do image inference for creative and high-quality results.
Introduction
Image inference is a powerful feature that allows you to generate images from text prompts or transform existing images according to your needs. This process is essential for creating high-quality visuals, whether you're looking to bring creative ideas to life or enhance existing images with new styles or subjects.

There are several types of image inference requests you can make using our API:

Text-to-Image: Generate images from descriptive text prompts. This process translates your text into high-quality visuals, allowing you to create detailed and vivid images based on your ideas.
Image-to-Image: Perform transformations on existing images, whether they are previously generated images or uploaded images. This process enables you to enhance, modify, or stylize images to create new and visually appealing content. With a single parameter you can control the strength of the transformation.
Inpainting: Replace parts of an image with new content, allowing you to remove unwanted elements or improve the overall composition of an image. It's like Image-to-Image but with a mask that defines the area to be transformed.
Outpainting: Extend the boundaries of an image by generating new content outside the original frame that seamlessly blends with the existing image. As Inpainting, it uses a mask to define the new area to be generated.
Our API also supports advanced features that allow developers to fine-tune the image generation process with precision:

ControlNet: A feature that enables precise control over image generation by using additional input conditions, such as edge maps, poses, or segmentation masks. This allows for more accurate alignment with specific user requirements or styles.
LoRA: A technique that helps in adapting models to specific styles or tasks by focusing on particular aspects of the data, enhancing the quality and relevance of the generated images.
Additionally, you can tweak numerous parameters to customize the output, such as adjusting the image dimension, steps, scheduler to use, and other generation settings, providing a high level of flexibility to suit your application's needs.

Our API is really fast because we have unique optimizations, custom-designed hardware, and many other elements that are part of our Sonic Inference Engine.

Request
Our API always accepts an array of objects as input, where each object represents a specific task to be performed. The structure of the object varies depending on the type of the task. For this section, we will focus on the parameters related to image inference tasks.

The following JSON snippets shows the basic structure of a request object. All properties are explained in detail in the next section.

[
  {
    "taskType": "imageInference",
    "taskUUID": "string",
    "outputType": "string",
    "outputFormat": "string",
    "positivePrompt": "string",
    "negativePrompt": "string",
    "height": int,
    "width": int,
    "model": "string",
    "steps": int,
    "CFGScale": float,
    "numberResults": int
  }
]
You can mix multiple ControlNet and LoRA objects in the same request to achieve more complex control over the generation process.

taskType
string
required
The type of task to be performed. For this task, the value should be imageInference.

taskUUID
string
required
UUID v4
When a task is sent to the API you must include a random UUID v4 string using the taskUUID parameter. This string is used to match the async responses to their corresponding tasks.

If you send multiple tasks at the same time, the taskUUID will help you match the responses to the correct tasks.

The taskUUID must be unique for each task you send to the API.

outputType
"base64Data" | "dataURI" | "URL"
Default: URL
Specifies the output type in which the image is returned. Supported values are: dataURI, URL, and base64Data.

base64Data: The image is returned as a base64-encoded string using the imageBase64Data parameter in the response object.
dataURI: The image is returned as a data URI string using the imageDataURI parameter in the response object.
URL: The image is returned as a URL string using the imageURL parameter in the response object.
outputFormat
"JPG" | "PNG" | "WEBP"
Default: JPG
Specifies the format of the output image. Supported formats are: PNG, JPG and WEBP.

outputQuality
integer
Min: 20
Max: 99
Default: 95
Sets the compression quality of the output image. Higher values preserve more quality but increase file size, lower values reduce file size but decrease quality.

uploadEndpoint
string
This parameter allows you to specify a URL to which the generated image will be uploaded as binary image data using the HTTP PUT method. For example, an S3 bucket URL can be used as the upload endpoint.

When the image is ready, it will be uploaded to the specified URL.

checkNSFW
boolean
Default: false
This parameter is used to enable or disable the NSFW check. When enabled, the API will check if the image contains NSFW (not safe for work) content. This check is done using a pre-trained model that detects adult content in images.

When the check is enabled, the API will return NSFWContent: true in the response object if the image is flagged as potentially sensitive content. If the image is not flagged, the API will return NSFWContent: false.

If this parameter is not used, the parameter NSFWContent will not be included in the response object.

Adds 0.1 seconds to image inference time and incurs additional costs.

The NSFW filter occasionally returns false positives and very rarely false negatives.

includeCost
boolean
Default: false
If set to true, the cost to perform the task will be included in the response object.

positivePrompt
string
required
A positive prompt is a text instruction to guide the model on generating the image. It is usually a sentence or a paragraph that provides positive guidance for the task. This parameter is essential to shape the desired results.

For example, if the positive prompt is "dragon drinking coffee", the model will generate an image of a dragon drinking coffee. The more detailed the prompt, the more accurate the results.

If you wish to generate an image without any prompt guidance, you can use the special token __BLANK__. This tells the system to generate an image without text-based instructions.

The length of the prompt must be between 2 and 3000 characters.

negativePrompt
string
A negative prompt is a text instruction to guide the model on generating the image. It is usually a sentence or a paragraph that provides negative guidance for the task. This parameter helps to avoid certain undesired results.

For example, if the negative prompt is "red dragon, cup", the model will follow the positive prompt but will avoid generating an image of a red dragon or including a cup. The more detailed the prompt, the more accurate the results.

The length of the prompt must be between 2 and 3000 characters.

seedImage
string
required
When doing Image-to-Image, Inpainting or Outpainting, this parameter is required.

Specifies the seed image to be used for the diffusion process. The image can be specified in one of the following formats:

An UUID v4 string of a previously uploaded image or a generated image.
A data URI string representing the image. The data URI must be in the format data:<mediaType>;base64, followed by the base64-encoded image. For example: data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgo....
A base64 encoded image without the data URI prefix. For example: iVBORw0KGgo....
A URL pointing to the image. The image must be accessible publicly.
Supported formats are: PNG, JPG and WEBP.

maskImage
string
required
When doing Inpainting, this parameter is required.

Specifies the mask image to be used for the inpainting process. The image can be specified in one of the following formats:

An UUID v4 string of a previously uploaded image or a generated image.
A data URI string representing the image. The data URI must be in the format data:<mediaType>;base64, followed by the base64-encoded image. For example: data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgo....
A base64 encoded image without the data URI prefix. For example: iVBORw0KGgo....
A URL pointing to the image. The image must be accessible publicly.
Supported formats are: PNG, JPG and WEBP.

maskMargin
integer
Min: 32
Max: 128
Adds extra context pixels around the masked region during inpainting. When this parameter is present, the model will zoom into the masked area, considering these additional pixels to create more coherent and well-integrated details.

This parameter is particularly effective when used with masks generated by the Image Masking API, enabling enhanced detail generation while maintaining natural integration with the surrounding image.

strength
float
Min: 0
Max: 1
Default: 0.8
When doing Image-to-Image or Inpainting, this parameter is used to determine the influence of the seedImage image in the generated output. A lower value results in more influence from the original image, while a higher value allows more creative deviation.

outpainting
object
Extends the image boundaries in specified directions. When using outpainting, you must provide the final dimensions using width and height parameters, which should account for the original image size plus the total extension (seedImage dimensions + top + bottom, left + right).

top
integer
Min: 0
Number of pixels to extend at the top of the image. Must be a multiple of 64.

right
integer
Min: 0
Number of pixels to extend at the right side of the image. Must be a multiple of 64.

bottom
integer
Min: 0
Number of pixels to extend at the bottom of the image. Must be a multiple of 64.

left
integer
Min: 0

The value must be divisible by 64, eg: 128...512, 576, 640...2048.

model
string
required
We make use of the AIR (Artificial Intelligence Resource) system to identify models. This identifier is a unique string that represents a specific model.

You can find the AIR identifier of the model you want to use in our Model Explorer, which is a tool that allows you to search for models based on their characteristics.

vae
string
We make use of the AIR (Artificial Intelligence Resource) system to identify VAE models. This identifier is a unique string that represents a specific model.

The VAE (Variational Autoencoder) can be specified to override the default one included with the base model, which can help improve the quality of generated images.

You can find the AIR identifier of the VAE model you want to use in our Model Explorer, which is a tool that allows you to search for models based on their characteristics.

steps
integer
Min: 1
Max: 100
Default: 20
The number of steps is the number of iterations the model will perform to generate the image. The higher the number of steps, the more detailed the image will be. However, increasing the number of steps will also increase the time it takes to generate the image and may not always result in a better image (some schedulers work differently).

When using your own models you can specify a new default value for the number of steps.

scheduler
string
Default: Model's scheduler
An scheduler is a component that manages the inference process. Different schedulers can be used to achieve different results like more detailed images, faster inference, or more accurate results.

The default scheduler is the one that the model was trained with, but you can choose a different one to get different results.

Schedulers are explained in more detail in the Schedulers page.

seed
integer
Min: 1
Max: 9223372036854776000
Default: Random
A seed is a value used to randomize the image generation. If you want to make images reproducible (generate the same image multiple times), you can use the same seed value.

When requesting multiple images with the same seed, the seed will be incremented by 1 (+1) for each image generated.

CFGScale
float
Min: 0
Max: 30
Default: 7
Guidance scale represents how closely the images will resemble the prompt or how much freedom the AI model has. Higher values are closer to the prompt. Low values may reduce the quality of the results.

clipSkip
integer
Min: 0
Max: 2
Defines additional layer skips during prompt processing in the CLIP model. Some models already skip layers by default - this parameter adds extra skips on top of those. Different values affect how your prompt is interpreted, which can lead to variations in the generated image.

promptWeighting
string
Defines the syntax to be used for prompt weighting.

Prompt weighting allows you to adjust how strongly different parts of your prompt influence the generated image. Choose between compel notation with advanced weighting operations or sdEmbeds for simple emphasis adjustments.

Max: 20
Default: 1
The number of images to generate from the specified prompt.

If seed is set, it will be incremented by 1 (+1) for each image generated.

refiner

Introduction
FLUX Tools is a suite of specialized models designed to add control to the base FLUX text-to-image models, enabling sophisticated modification and re-creation of real and generated images. These tools integrate seamlessly with our standard Image Inference API while offering expanded capabilities for specific image manipulation tasks.

The FLUX Tools suite consists of four distinct features:

FLUX Fill (runware:102@1): State-of-the-art inpainting and outpainting capabilities for editing and expanding images.
FLUX Canny (runware:104@1): Structural guidance based on canny edges extracted from input images.
FLUX Depth (runware:103@1): Structural guidance based on depth maps extracted from input images.
FLUX Redux (runware:105@1): Image variation and restyling for refining or transforming existing images.
Each tool is optimized for specific use cases while maintaining the quality and performance that FLUX models are known for.

FLUX Tools models are used through the same standard Image Inference task but with specific parameter combinations and restrictions. This documentation covers the unique requirements for each tool.

FLUX Fill: Advanced Inpainting
FLUX Fill introduces advanced inpainting capabilities that allow for seamless editing that integrates naturally with existing images. It also supports outpainting, enabling extension of images beyond their original borders.

Usage
FLUX Fill is used with the following specific configuration:

Use base model AIR ID runware:102@1.
Provide seedImage and maskImage as you would for standard inpainting.
Unlike regular inpainting models, FLUX Fill does not support the maskMargin parameter for zoomed/detailed inpainting.
The strength parameter is also not compatible with this model, the balance between existing and new content is controlled entirely through prompting.

FLUX Canny/Depth: Structural conditioning
Structural conditioning models use canny edge or depth detection to maintain precise control during image inference. By preserving the original image's structure through edge or depth maps, users can make text-guided images while keeping the core composition intact, which is particularly effective for retexturing images and style transformations.

FLUX Canny and Depth are hybrid models that combine the base FLUX image generation capabilities with embedded ControlNet functionality. Unlike standard ControlNet usage, FLUX Canny/Depth tools don't require a controlNet object. Instead, the guide image is provided directly in the seedImage parameter.

Usage
Use base model AIR ID runware:104@1 for FLUX Canny or runware:103@1 for FLUX Depth.
Provide the structural guide image (edge map or depth map) directly in the seedImage parameter.
There is no weight parameter for FLUX Canny/Depth. The strength of the conditioning can't be controlled.

Preparing guide images
You can use our ControlNet preprocessing tools to generate appropriate edge or depth maps:

For FLUX Canny: Use the canny preprocessor type.
For FLUX Depth: Use the depth preprocessor type.

}
Use Cases
FLUX Canny/Depth excel at:

Style Transfer: Transform image styles while maintaining structural composition and spatial relationships.
Content Preservation: Generate new images that follow the exact structure of reference images.
Scene Retexturing: Modify materials and textures while preserving object shapes and positions.
Artistic Reinterpretation: Create artistic variants of photos with consistent structure but creative styling.
Consistent Series Generation: Produce multiple variations with identical structural elements but different details.

FLUX Redux: Image variation and restyling
FLUX Redux is an IP-Adapter model that enables image variation generation. Given an input image (guide image), FLUX Redux can reproduce the image with variations, allowing refinement of existing images or creating multiple alternatives based on a single reference.

Usage
FLUX Redux requires a different approach than the other FLUX tools:

Use iP-Adapter model AIR ID runware:105@1.
Provide the input image in the guideImage parameter inside the ipAdapters object.
Use a FLUX base model (typically FLUX dev model - runware:101@1) as the base model. Other FLUX models can be used as well.
There is no weight parameter for FLUX Redux. The variation level and guidance can be controlled through the positivePrompt parameter.
To generate pure variations of the input image without any prompt guidance, use __BLANK__ as your positivePrompt. This special keyword tells the model to focus exclusively on the visual information from the input image, creating variations that maintain its core characteristics without additional text influences.

      }
    ]
  }
]
Use cases
FLUX Redux excels at:

Image Variations: Generate subtle alternatives of an input image while preserving key visual elements.
Style Adaptation: Modify the artistic style of an image while maintaining subject recognition.
Visual Concept Mixing: Combine visual concepts from the input image with new elements specified in the prompt.
Subject Preservation: Ensure specific subjects or elements remain recognizable across style transformations.
Best practices
For optimal results with FLUX Tools, consider these best practices:

FLUX Fill performs best with clear, defined masks with slight feathering at the edges.
For FLUX Canny, adjust the edge detection thresholds in preprocessing to control level of detail.
Higher step counts often yield better results for complex transformations.
Consider using a higher CFG scale when precision is required.
