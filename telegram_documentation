Initializing Mini Apps
To connect your Mini App to the Telegram client, place the script telegram-web-app.js in the <head> tag before any other scripts, using this code:

<script src="https://telegram.org/js/telegram-web-app.js?56"></script>
Once the script is connected, a window.Telegram.WebApp object will become available with the following fields:

Field	Type	Description
initData	String	A string with raw data transferred to the Mini App, convenient for validating data.
WARNING: Validate data from this field before using it on the bot's server.
initDataUnsafe	WebAppInitData	An object with input data transferred to the Mini App.
WARNING: Data from this field should not be trusted. You should only use data from initData on the bot's server and only after it has been validated.
version	String	The version of the Bot API available in the user's Telegram app.
platform	String	The name of the platform of the user's Telegram app.
colorScheme	String	The color scheme currently used in the Telegram app. Either “light” or “dark”.
Also available as the CSS variable var(--tg-color-scheme).
themeParams	ThemeParams	An object containing the current theme settings used in the Telegram app.
isActive NEW	Boolean	Bot API 8.0+ True, if the Mini App is currently active. False, if the Mini App is minimized.
isExpanded	Boolean	True, if the Mini App is expanded to the maximum available height. False, if the Mini App occupies part of the screen and can be expanded to the full height using the expand() method.
viewportHeight	Float	The current height of the visible area of the Mini App. Also available in CSS as the variable var(--tg-viewport-height).

The application can display just the top part of the Mini App, with its lower part remaining outside the screen area. From this position, the user can “pull” the Mini App to its maximum height, while the bot can do the same by calling the expand() method. As the position of the Mini App changes, the current height value of the visible area will be updated in real time.

Please note that the refresh rate of this value is not sufficient to smoothly follow the lower border of the window. It should not be used to pin interface elements to the bottom of the visible area. It's more appropriate to use the value of the viewportStableHeight field for this purpose.
viewportStableHeight	Float	The height of the visible area of the Mini App in its last stable state. Also available in CSS as a variable var(--tg-viewport-stable-height).

The application can display just the top part of the Mini App, with its lower part remaining outside the screen area. From this position, the user can “pull” the Mini App to its maximum height, while the bot can do the same by calling the expand() method. Unlike the value of viewportHeight, the value of viewportStableHeight does not change as the position of the Mini App changes with user gestures or during animations. The value of viewportStableHeight will be updated after all gestures and animations are completed and the Mini App reaches its final size.

Note the event viewportChanged with the passed parameter isStateStable=true, which will allow you to track when the stable state of the height of the visible area changes.
headerColor	String	Current header color in the #RRGGBB format.
backgroundColor	String	Current background color in the #RRGGBB format.
bottomBarColor	String	Current bottom bar color in the #RRGGBB format.
isClosingConfirmationEnabled	Boolean	True, if the confirmation dialog is enabled while the user is trying to close the Mini App. False, if the confirmation dialog is disabled.
isVerticalSwipesEnabled	Boolean	True, if vertical swipes to close or minimize the Mini App are enabled. False, if vertical swipes to close or minimize the Mini App are disabled. In any case, the user will still be able to minimize and close the Mini App by swiping the Mini App's header.
isFullscreen NEW	Boolean	True, if the Mini App is currently being displayed in fullscreen mode.
isOrientationLocked NEW	Boolean	True, if the Mini App’s orientation is currently locked. False, if orientation changes freely based on the device’s rotation.

Validating data received via the Mini App
To validate data received via the Mini App, one should send the data from the Telegram.WebApp.initData field to the bot's backend. The data is a query string, which is composed of a series of field-value pairs.

You can verify the integrity of the data received by comparing the received hash parameter with the hexadecimal representation of the HMAC-SHA-256 signature of the data-check-string with the secret key, which is the HMAC-SHA-256 signature of the bot's token with the constant string WebAppData used as a key.

Data-check-string is a chain of all received fields, sorted alphabetically, in the format key=<value> with a line feed character ('\n', 0x0A) used as separator – e.g., 'auth_date=<auth_date>\nquery_id=<query_id>\nuser=<user>'.

The full check might look like:

data_check_string = ...
secret_key = HMAC_SHA256(<bot_token>, "WebAppData")
if (hex(HMAC_SHA256(data_check_string, secret_key)) == hash) {
  // data is from Telegram
}
To prevent the use of outdated data, you can additionally check the auth_date field, which contains a Unix timestamp of when it was received by the Mini App.

Once validated, the data may be used on your server. Complex data types are represented as JSON-serialized objects.

Validating data for Third-Party Use
NEW If you need to share the data with a third party, they can validate the data without requiring access to your bot's token. Simply provide them with the data from the Telegram.WebApp.initData field and your bot_id.

The integrity of the data can be verified by validating the received signature parameter, which is the base64url-encoded representation of the Ed25519 signature of the data-check-string. The verification is performed using the public key provided by Telegram.

Data-check-string is constructed as follows:
1. Prepend the bot_id, followed by : and the constant string WebAppData.
2. Add a line feed character ('\n', 0x0A).
3. Append all received fields (except hash and signature), sorted alphabetically, in the format key=<value>.
4. Separate each key-value pair with a line feed character ('\n', 0x0A).

Example:
'12345678:WebAppData\nauth_date=<auth_date>\nquery_id=<query_id>\nuser=<user>'

The verification process might look like this:

data_check_string = ...
public_key = "<Telegram_public_key>"
if (Ed25519_verify(public_key, data_check_string, signature)) {
  // data is valid and originated from Telegram
}
Telegram provides the following Ed25519 public keys for signature verification:

Test environment: 40055058a4ee38156a06562e52eece92a771bcd8346a8c4615cb7376eddf72ec (hex)
Production: e7bf03a2fa4602af4580703d88dda5bb59f32ed8b02a56c187fe7d34caed242d (hex)

To prevent the use of outdated data, the third party should additionally validate the auth_date field. This field contains a Unix timestamp indicating when the data was received by the Mini App.

Once validated, the data may be used. Complex data types are represented as JSON-serialized objects.

Adding Bots to the Attachment Menu
Attachment menu integration is currently only available for major advertisers on the Telegram Ad Platform. However, all bots can use it in the test server environment. Talk to Botfather on the test server to set up the integration.

A special link is used to add bots to the attachment menu:

https://t.me/botusername?startattach
or
https://t.me/botusername?startattach=command

For example, open this attachment menu link for @DurgerKingBot, then use the Attach menu in any private chat.

Opening the link prompts the user to add the bot to their attachment menu. If the bot has already been added, the attachment menu will open in the current chat and redirect to the bot there (if the link is opened from a 1-on-1 chat). If a non-empty startattach parameter was included in the link, it will be passed to the Mini App in the start_param field and in the GET parameter tgWebAppStartParam.

The following link formats are also supported:

https://t.me/username?attach=botusername
https://t.me/username?attach=botusername&startattach=command
https://t.me/+1234567890?attach=botusername
https://t.me/+1234567890?attach=botusername&startattach=command

These links open the Mini App in the attachment menu in the chat with a specific user. If the bot wasn't already added to the attachment menu, the user will be prompted to do so. If a non-empty startattach parameter was included in the link, it will be passed to the Mini App in the start_param field and in the GET parameter tgWebAppStartParam.

Bot API 6.1+ supports a new link format:

https://t.me/botusername?startattach&choose=users+bots
https://t.me/botusername?startattach=command&choose=groups+channels

Opening such a link prompts the user to choose a specific chat and opens the attachment menu in that chat. If the bot wasn't already added to the attachment menu, the user will be prompted to do so. You can specify which types of chats the user will be able to choose from. It can be one or more of the following types: users, bots, groups, channels separated by a + sign. If a non-empty startattach parameter was included in the link, it will be passed to the Mini App in the start_param field and in the GET parameter tgWebAppStartParam.

Additional Data in User-Agent
When the Mini App is running on Android, additional information is appended to the User-Agent string to provide more context about the app environment. This information includes the app version, device model, Android version, SDK version, and device performance class, formatted as follows:

Telegram-Android/{app_version} ({manufacturer} {model}; Android {android_version}; SDK {sdk_version}; {performance_class})
where:

{app_version} is the version of the Telegram app (e.g., 11.3.3),
{manufacturer} {model} represents the device’s manufacturer and model (e.g., Google sdk_gphone64_arm64),
{android_version} is the Android OS version running on the device (e.g., 14),
{sdk_version} indicates the Android SDK version (e.g., 34),
{performance_class} specifies the device performance class as LOW, AVERAGE, or HIGH, indicating the device's performance capacity.
Example
Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 14; K) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/113.0.5672.136 Mobile Safari/537.36 Telegram-Android/11.3.3 (Google sdk_gphone64_arm64; Android 14; SDK 34; LOW)

We recommend using this information to optimize your Mini App based on the device's capabilities. For instance, you can adjust animations and visual effects in games on low-performance devices to ensure a smooth experience for all users, regardless of device specifications.
